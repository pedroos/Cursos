HOW DOES CFD WORK?

Partial differential equations are discretized into a system of algebraic equations.

Setting up the solver: for a given problem, you will need to:
-Define material properties
-Select appropriate physical models
-Prescribe operating conditions
-Prescribe boundary conditions at all boundary zones
-Set up solver controls

For complex problems, solving a simplified or 2D problem will provide valuable experience with the models and solver settings for your problem in a short amount of time.

The discretized conservation equations are solved iteratively until convergence. Convergence is reached when changes in solution variables from one iteration to the next are negligible.
