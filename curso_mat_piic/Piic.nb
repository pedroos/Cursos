 "Between 1902 and 1908 Bertrand Russell proposed various \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]theories of type\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] in response \
to his discovery that Gottlob Frege\[CloseCurlyQuote]s version of naive set \
theory was afflicted with Russell\[CloseCurlyQuote]s paradox. By 1908 Russell \
arrived at a \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]ramified\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] theory \
of types together with an \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]axiom of reducibility\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] both of which featured prominently in Whitehead and \
Russell\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Principia Mathematica published between 1910 and \
1913. They attempted to resolve Russell\[CloseCurlyQuote]s paradox by first \
creating a hierarchy of types, then assigning each concrete mathematical (and \
possibly other) entity to a type. Entities of a given type are built \
exclusively from entities of those types that are lower in their hierarchy, \
thus preventing an entity from being assigned to itself.",

 "With Russell\[CloseCurlyQuote]s discovery (1901, 1902) of a paradox in \
Gottlob Frege\[CloseCurlyQuote]s 1879 Begriffsschrift and Frege\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s acknowledgment of the same (1902), Russell tentatively \
introduced his solution as \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Appendix B: Doctrine of \
Types\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] in his 1903 The Principles of Mathematics. This \
contradiction can be stated as \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]the class of all \
classes that do not contain themselves as elements\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. \
At the end of this appendix Russell asserts that his \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]doctrine\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] would solve the \
immediate problem posed by Frege, but \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]there is at \
least one closely analogous contradiction which is probably not soluble by \
this doctrine. The totality of all logical objects, or of all propositions, \
involves, it would seem a fundamental logical difficulty. What the complete \
solution of the difficulty may be, I have not succeeded in discovering; but \
as it affects the very foundations of reasoning...\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\n\n\
By the time of his 1908 Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types \
Russell had studied \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]the contradictions\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] (among them the Epimenides paradox, the Burali-Forti \
paradox, and Richard\[CloseCurlyQuote]s paradox) and concluded that \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]In all the contradictions there is a common \
characteristic, which we may describe as self-reference or reflexiveness\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote].\n\nIn 1903, Russell defined predicative functions \
as those whose order is one more than the highest-order function occurring in \
the expression of the function. While these were fine for the situation, \
impredicative functions had to be disallowed:\n\nA function whose argument is \
an individual and whose value is always a first-order proposition will be \
called a first-order function. A function involving a first-order function or \
proposition as apparent variable will be called a second-order function, and \
so on. A function of one variable which is of the order next above that of \
its argument will be called a predicative function; the same name will be \
given to a function of several variables (etc).\n\nHe repeats this definition \
in a slightly different way later in the paper (together with a subtle \
prohibition that they would express more clearly in 1913):\nA predicative \
function of x is one whose values are propositions of the type next above \
that of x, if x is an individual or a proposition, or that of values of x if \
x is a function. It may be described as one in which the apparent variables, \
if any, are all of the same type as x or of lower type; and a variable is of \
lower type than x if it can significantly occur as argument to x, or as \
argument to an argument to x, and so forth.\n\nThis usage carries over to \
Alfred North Whitehead and Russell\[CloseCurlyQuote]s 1913 Principia \
Mathematica wherein the authors devote an entire subsection of their Chapter \
II: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Theory of Logical \
Types\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] to subchapter I.",

arranging all sentences (or, more precisely, all propositional functions, \

This solution to Russell\[CloseCurlyQuote]s paradox is motivated in large \
part by adoption of the so-called vicious circle
principle. The principle in effect states that no propositional function can \

application. In other words, before a function can be defined, one must first \
specify
exactly those objects to which the function will apply (the function\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s domain). For example, before defining the predicate \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]is a prime number,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] one first \
needs to define the collection of objects that might possibly satisfy this \
predicate, namely the set, N, of natural numbers.\

As Whitehead and Russell explain, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]An analysis of the \
paradoxes to be avoided shows that they all result from a kind of vicious \
circle. The vicious circles in question arise from supposing that a \
collection of objects may contain members which can only be defined by means \
of the collection as a whole. Thus, for example, the collection of \
propositions will be supposed to contain a proposition stating that \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]all propositions are either true or false.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] It would seem, however, that such a statement could \
not be legitimate unless \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]all propositions\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] referred to some already definite collection, which \
it cannot do if new propositions are created by statements about \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]all propositions.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] We shall, \
therefore, have to say that statements about \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]all \
propositions\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] are meaningless. \[Ellipsis] The \
principle which enables us to avoid illegitimate totalities may be stated as \
follows: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Whatever involves all of a collection must \
not be one of the collection\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]; or, conversely: \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]If, provided a certain collection had a total, it \
would have members only definable in terms of that total, then the said \
collection has no total.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] We shall call this the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]vicious-circle principle,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \

of illegitimate totalities.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] (1910, 2nd edn 37)\

Although Russell first introduced his theory of types in his 1903 Principles \
of Mathematics, he recognized
immediately that more work needed to be done since his initial account seemed \
to resolve some but not all of the paradoxes. Among the alternatives he \
considered was a so-called substitutional theory (Galaugher 2013). This in \
turn led to type theory\[CloseCurlyQuote]s more mature expression five years \
later in Russell\[CloseCurlyQuote]s 1908 article, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Mathematical Logic as Based on the Theory of Types,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and in the monumental work he co-authored with \
Alfred North Whitehead, Principia Mathematica (1910, 1912, 1913). Russell\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s type theory thus appears in two versions: the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]simple theory\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] of 1903 and the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]ramified theory\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] of 1908. Both \

Russell\[CloseCurlyQuote]s paradox is sometimes seen as a negative \

remains controversial, later research has revealed that the paradox does not \
necessarily short circuit Frege\[CloseCurlyQuote]s derivation of arithmetic \
from logic alone. Frege\[CloseCurlyQuote]s version of NC (his Axiom V) can \
simply be abandoned. (For details, see the entry on Frege\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
Theorem.) For another, Church gives an elegant formulation of the simple \
theory of types that has proven fruitful even in areas removed from the \
foundations of mathematics. (For details, see the entry on Type Theory.) \
Finally, the development of axiomatic (as opposed to na\[IDoubleDot]ve) set \
theories which exhibit various ingenious and mathematically and \

express the energy (or more precisely the action) in as many ways as \
possible. If it does not work, one has to search for a new (universal) \
constant. For example, Planck\[CloseCurlyQuote]s constant allows to express \
the energy using a frequency \[Dash] pretty cool.\n\nDo you think units in \
physics are a hack (because researchers did not yet find all universal \
constants) and if yes, how would you formulate an action principle?"

 ": The creation of set theory can be traced back to the work of XIX century \
mathematicians who tried to find a firm foundation for calculus. While the \
early contributors to the subject (Bolzano, Du Bois Reymond, Dedekind) were \
concerned with sets of numbers or of functions, the propert founder of set \
theory, Georg Cantor, made a decisive step and started an investigation of \
sets with arbitrary elements. The series of articles published by him in the \
years 1871-1883 contains an almost modern exposition of the theory of \
cardinals and of ordered and well-ordered sets. That step toward \
generalizations which Cantor made was a difficult one was witnessed by \
various contradictions (antinomies of set theory) discovered in set theory by \
various authors around 1900. The crisis created by these antinomies was \
overcome by Zermelo who formulated in 1904-1908 the first system of axios of \
set theory. His axioms were sufficient to obtain all mathematically important \
results of set theory and at the same time did not allow the reconstruction \
of any known antinomy. Close ties between set theory and philosophy of \
mathematics date back to discussions concerning the nature of anotinomies and \
the axiomatization of set theory. The fundamental problems of philosophy of \
mathematics such as the meaning of existence in mathematics, axiomatics \
versus description of reality, the need of consistency proofs and means \
admissible in such proofs were never better illustrated than in these \
discussions."

 ": Suppes (1967) suggested that in order to axiomatize a theory--any \
mathematically\nformulated theory--we must define a set-theoretic predicate. \
A set-theoretic predicate is simply a predicate in the formal language of a \
given axiomatic set theory. We thus have a nice and convenient recipe for the \
construction of axiomatized versions for many theories in the realm of \
natural science, granted that they can be given a precise mathematical \
formulation, as all of everyday mathematics can be formulated within an \
established axiomatic set theory such as the Zermelo-Fraenkel system. Da \
Costa and Chuaqui (1988) related Suppes predicates to the Bourbaki (1957) \
structure concept, and da Costa and Doria (1989b) gave a summary axiomatic \
treatment for most of classical (or first-quantized) physics."
