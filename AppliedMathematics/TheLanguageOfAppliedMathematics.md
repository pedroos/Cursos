# The language of applied mathematics

Nicholas J. Highham, The Princeton Companion to Applied Mathematics, Princeton University Press, 2015.

### Notation

### Complex numbers

Most applied mathematics takes place in the set of complex numbers, $\mathbb{C}$, or the set of real numbers, $\mathbb{R}$.

### Coordinate systems

Cartesian coordinates.

Polar coordinates.

Spherical coordinates.

Cylindrical coordinates.

### Functions

Multivalued functions.

Linear function. Affine function.

Odd and even function.

Multivariate functions.

### Limits and continuity

Convergence: determining $\large{\delta}$ as a function of $\large{\varepsilon}$.

One-sided limits.

Continuity at a point.

Continuity at an interval. Lipschitz continuity.

Limit of a sequence.

Convergence of infinite series. Partial sums.
